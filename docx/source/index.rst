Introduction
============
     This document describes the Little Hill Lab's initial requirements for an onlineapplication (Oh My Genes) which allows our   scientists to upload gene expression filesand quickly get differentially expressed genes.

* :ref:`(1.1)Purpose`
         To identify differentially expressed genes given a gene expression file containingtwo cell samples.
* :ref:`(1.2)Additional information`
         Genes (genetic factors) are DNA fragments with genetic effects (some viruses such as tobacco mosaic virus and HIV's genetic material are RNA). Genes support the basic structure and performance of life. All the information stored in the process of race, blood type, inoculation, growth, apoptosis and so on. Environmental and genetic interdependence is an important physiological process of reproduction, cell division and protein synthesis. All life phenomena such as birth, growth, decay, disease, old age and death are related to genes. It is also an intrinsic factor in determining the health of life. Therefore, genes have dual attributes: materiality (existence mode) and Information Nature (fundamental attribute).
DNA fragments with genetic information are called genes, and other DNA sequences, some play a role directly in their own structures, and some are involved in regulating the performance of genetic information. At least 265 to 350 genes are needed to make a simple life. (this involves the power of the gene working group. The human genome working group is basically similar to that of Drosophila).
